# weatherapp

This is a project I made to learn more about graphql. 

ItÂ´s a pretty basic app where you can search on a city and get the weather status. The information gets rendered in a card with local time, temperature, wind, and how cloudy 
it is right now that gets rendered as a svg (rain, cloudy, sunny).

If you want to check it out just follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and cd in to the client folder and run npm install.
3. Open a new terminal and cd in to root folder (outside of the client folder) and run, npm install.
4. In the root terminal run, npm run dev.
5. Open the first terminal (client folder) and run, npm start.

Now you should be able to see that it probably rains in Stockholm ;)
